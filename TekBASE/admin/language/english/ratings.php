If a rating is offensive, you can request its deletion from TekLab and you will be sent a code for that purpose. For all other ratings, try to reconcile. If this is successful, the customer can confirm this by clicking on a link. If conciliation is activated, this will be noted on the rating page. You will then need to contact the customer to clarify the situation.");
